# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature establishes a comprehensive UI design system that combines Apple's Human Interface Guidelines principles with modern tech company aesthetics (Netflix, Next.js) to create a cohesive, accessible, and production-ready design language. The system will serve as the foundation for Tailwind CSS configuration and Storybook component documentation, ensuring consistent user experience across the entire portfolio application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Color System

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a comprehensive color system with semantic tokens, so that I can maintain visual consistency and support both light and dark themes throughout the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN implementing color tokens THEN the system SHALL support both light and dark theme variants with proper contrast ratios
3. WHEN using semantic colors THEN each color SHALL meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast requirements (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
4. WHEN defining color scales THEN the system SHALL provide 50-900 weight variations for each color family
5. IF a color is used for interactive elements THEN the system SHALL include hover, active, and disabled state variants

### Requirement 2: Typography System

**User Story:** As a designer and developer, I want a scalable typography system with clear hierarchy, so that content is readable and accessible across all devices and use cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining font families THEN the system SHALL include primary (sans-serif), secondary (serif), and monospace font stacks with web-safe fallbacks
2. WHEN creating type scales THEN the system SHALL provide responsive font sizes from xs (12px) to 6xl (64px) with appropriate line heights
3. WHEN setting typography hierarchy THEN the system SHALL define h1-h6 headings, body text variants, and specialized text styles (caption, overline, etc.)
4. WHEN implementing responsive typography THEN font sizes SHALL scale appropriately across mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints
5. IF text is used for UI elements THEN the system SHALL ensure minimum 16px font size for touch targets on mobile

### Requirement 3: Spacing and Layout System

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a consistent spacing system based on mathematical progression, so that layouts feel harmonious and predictable across all components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining spacing tokens THEN the system SHALL use a base unit (4px or 8px) with consistent mathematical progression
2. WHEN creating layout utilities THEN the system SHALL provide spacing values from 0 to 96 (0px to 384px) in the chosen progression
3. WHEN implementing component spacing THEN the system SHALL define internal padding and external margin standards
4. WHEN designing responsive layouts THEN spacing SHALL adapt appropriately across different screen sizes
5. IF components are nested THEN the system SHALL provide clear guidelines for spacing relationships

### Requirement 4: Border Radius and Shape System

**User Story:** As a designer, I want a cohesive border radius system that reflects modern design trends, so that components feel contemporary and unified.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining border radius values THEN the system SHALL include none, sm, md, lg, xl, 2xl, 3xl, and full variants
2. WHEN applying rounded corners THEN the system SHALL provide component-specific radius guidelines (buttons, cards, inputs, etc.)
3. WHEN creating interactive elements THEN border radius SHALL remain consistent across all states (hover, active, disabled)
4. WHEN designing for mobile THEN touch targets SHALL use appropriate radius for finger-friendly interaction
5. IF components contain nested elements THEN inner radius SHALL be calculated to maintain visual consistency

### Requirement 5: Shadow and Elevation System

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a layered shadow system that creates clear visual hierarchy, so that users can understand content relationships and interactive affordances.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining shadow levels THEN the system SHALL provide 6 elevation levels (none, sm, md, lg, xl, 2xl) with appropriate blur and offset values
2. WHEN applying shadows THEN each level SHALL convey clear hierarchy and depth relationships
3. WHEN implementing interactive shadows THEN hover states SHALL use elevated shadow levels to indicate interactivity
4. WHEN supporting dark mode THEN shadows SHALL adapt with appropriate opacity and color adjustments
5. IF shadows are used on colored backgrounds THEN they SHALL maintain visibility and contrast

### Requirement 6: Component Design Standards

**User Story:** As a developer, I want standardized component designs with clear specifications, so that I can build consistent UI elements that work seamlessly together.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN designing buttons THEN the system SHALL define primary, secondary, tertiary, and destructive variants with size options (sm, md, lg)
2. WHEN creating cards THEN the system SHALL specify padding, border radius, shadow, and content organization patterns
3. WHEN implementing form elements THEN the system SHALL ensure consistent styling for inputs, selects, checkboxes, and radio buttons
4. WHEN designing navigation elements THEN the system SHALL provide clear active, hover, and focus states
5. IF components have loading states THEN the system SHALL define skeleton and spinner patterns

### Requirement 7: Accessibility and Inclusive Design

**User Story:** As a user with disabilities, I want the design system to be fully accessible, so that I can use the application effectively regardless of my abilities or assistive technologies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing color combinations THEN all text SHALL meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast requirements
2. WHEN designing interactive elements THEN touch targets SHALL be minimum 44px Ã— 44px for mobile devices
3. WHEN creating focus indicators THEN they SHALL be clearly visible with 2px minimum outline and high contrast colors
4. WHEN implementing animations THEN they SHALL respect prefers-reduced-motion user preferences
5. IF components convey information through color THEN alternative indicators (icons, text, patterns) SHALL be provided

### Requirement 8: Responsive Design Guidelines

**User Story:** As a user on any device, I want the interface to adapt seamlessly to my screen size, so that I have an optimal experience regardless of my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining breakpoints THEN the system SHALL use mobile-first approach with sm (640px), md (768px), lg (1024px), xl (1280px), and 2xl (1536px)
2. WHEN implementing responsive components THEN they SHALL adapt gracefully across all breakpoint ranges
3. WHEN designing for touch devices THEN interactive elements SHALL be appropriately sized and spaced for finger navigation
4. WHEN creating layouts THEN they SHALL use flexible grid systems and container queries where appropriate
5. IF content overflows THEN the system SHALL provide clear scrolling and navigation patterns

### Requirement 9: Animation and Interaction Guidelines

**User Story:** As a user, I want smooth and purposeful animations that enhance the interface, so that interactions feel responsive and delightful without being distracting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining animation durations THEN the system SHALL use consistent timing (150ms for micro-interactions, 300ms for transitions, 500ms for complex animations)
2. WHEN implementing easing curves THEN they SHALL feel natural using cubic-bezier functions appropriate for each interaction type
3. WHEN creating hover effects THEN they SHALL provide immediate feedback with smooth transitions
4. WHEN designing loading states THEN animations SHALL indicate progress and maintain user engagement
5. IF users have motion sensitivity THEN all animations SHALL be reducible or removable via prefers-reduced-motion

### Requirement 10: Dark Mode and Theme Support

**User Story:** As a user, I want to choose between light and dark themes, so that I can use the application comfortably in different lighting conditions and according to my preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing theme switching THEN both light and dark modes SHALL be fully supported with appropriate color adaptations
2. WHEN designing for dark mode THEN colors SHALL maintain proper contrast ratios and visual hierarchy
3. WHEN switching themes THEN the transition SHALL be smooth and preserve user context
4. WHEN using system preferences THEN the application SHALL respect the user's OS-level theme setting by default
5. IF custom themes are added THEN the system SHALL support extensible theme architecture
